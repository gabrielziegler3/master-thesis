%% WHAT is PDF/A
%%
%% PDF/A is the ISO-standardized version of the pdf. The standard's goal is to
%% ensure that he file is reproducable even after a long time. PDF/A differs
%% from pdf in that it allows only those pdf features that support long-term
%% archiving of a file. For example, PDF/A requires that all used fonts are
%% embedded in the file, whereas a normal pdf can contain only a link to the
%% fonts in the system of the reader of the file. PDF/A also requires, among
%% other things, data on colour definition and the encryption used.
%% Currently three PDF/A standards exist:
%% PDF/A-1: based on PDF 1.4, standard ISO19005-1, published in 2005.
%%          Includes all the requirements essential for long-term archiving.
%% PDF/A-2: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-2, published in 2011.
%%          In addition to the above, it supports embedding of OpenType fonts,
%%          transparency in the colour definition and digital signatures.
%% PDF/A-3: based on PDF 1.7, standard ISO19005-3, published in 2012.
%%          Differs from the above only in that it allows embedding of files in
%%          any format (e.g., xml, csv, cad, spreadsheet or wordprocessing
%%          formats) into the pdf file.
%% PDF/A-4: based on PDF 2.0, standard ISO19005-4, published in November 2020.
%%
%% PDF/A-1 files are not necessarily PDF/A-2 -compatible and PDF/A-2 are not
%% necessarily PDF/A-1 -compatible.
%% Standards PDF/A-1, PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3 have two levels:
%% b: (basic) requires that the visual appearance of the document is reliably
%%    reproduceable.
%% a (accessible) in addition to the b-level requirements, specifies how
%%   accessible the pdf file is to assistive software, say, for the physically
%%   impaired.
%% The PDF/A-4 standard does not have additional levels like in the earlier
%% standards.
%% For more details on PDF/A, see, e.g.,
%% https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000318.shtml or
%% https://www.pdfa.org/resource/iso-19005-pdfa/
%%
%%
%% WHICH PDF/A standard should my thesis conform to?
%%
%% Either to the PDF/A-1b or the PDF/A-2b standard. If all the figures and
%% graphs used in thesis work do not require transparency features, use either
%% PDF/A-1b or PFDF/A-2b. If you have figures with transparency
%% characteristics, use the PDF/A-2b standard. However, drawing applications
%% often use the transparency parameter, setting it to zero, to specify opacity
%% and get the basic 2-D visualisation. As a result, validation of PDF/A-1b
%% will fail. Use PDF/A-2b if PDF/A-1b validation fails.
%% Do not use the PDF/A-3b standard for your thesis.
%% The font to be used are specified in this templatenand they should not be
%% changed. In addition to not adhering to Aalto's visual guidelines, you may
%% have difficulties in producing a PDF/A-compliant PDF.
%%
%%
%% Validate your PDF/A file at https://www.pdf-online.com/osa/validate.aspx
%%
%%
%% WHAT graphics format can I use to produce my PDF/A compliant file?
%%
%% When using pdflatex to compile your work, favour the use of pdf, but you can
%% use the jpg or png format especially for photographs. You will have PDF/A
%% compliance problems with figures in pdf if the fonts are not embedded in the
%% pdf file.
%% If you choose to use latex to compile your work, the only acceptable file
%% format for your figure is eps. DO NOT use the ps format for your figures.

%% USE one of the following three \documentclass set-ups:
%% * the first when using pdflatex to directly typeset your document in the
%%   chosen pdf/a format for online publishing (centred page layout),
%% * the second for one-sided printing your thesis with the layout (wide left
%%   margin), or
%% * the third for two-sided printing.

%% The abstract text. This text in one paragraph is included in the metadata of

%% abstract rewrite it in the abstarct environment as described below.
%%
\thesisabstract{%
The abstract is a short description of the essential contents of the thesis
usually in one paragraph: what was studied and how and what were the main
findings. For a Finnish thesis, the abstract should be written in both Finnish
and English; for a Swedish thesis, in Swedish and English. The abstracts for
English theses written by Finnish or Swedish speakers should be written in
English and either in Finnish or in Swedish, depending on the student’s language
of basic education. Students educated in languages other than Finnish or Swedish
write the abstract only in English. Students may include a second or third
abstract in their native language, if they wish.
The abstract text of this thesis is written on the readable abstract page as
well as into the pdf file's metadata via the thesisabstract macro (see the
comment in the TeX file). Write here the text that goes into the metadata. The
metadata cannot contain special characters, linebreak or paragraph break
characters, so these must not be used here. If your abstract does not contain
special characters and it does not require paragraphs, you may take advantage of
the abstracttext macro (see the comment in the TeX file below). Otherwise, the

\subsection{Background of the Field of Study}

The field of data extraction from financial reports has evolved significantly with advancements in text processing and machine learning technologies. Historically, this task involved manual data entry or rule-based systems that were labor-intensive and prone to errors. The emergence of \ac{LLMs}, such as \ac{GPT} and \ac{BERT}, has revolutionized this domain. These models have the ability to understand and extract complex financial information from unstructured data, thereby increasing accuracy and efficiency. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of \ac{LLMs} in automating financial data extraction, highlighting improvements in processing time and data accuracy over traditional methods.

\subsection{General Objective}

This study aims to extend the current capabilities of data extraction systems by incorporating advanced \ac{LLMs} and exploring novel methodologies in the field.
The primary goals include: ellaborating a comprehensive comparison of methods for extracting information from financial reports, with a focus on non-standard reports,

enhancing the precision and efficiency of data extraction from financial reports, developing a scalable system capable of processing large volumes of data, and comparing the effectiveness of various \ac{LLMs} and extraction techniques. By achieving these goals, the study seeks to contribute to the broader understanding of automated data extraction and its application in financial analysis.

\subsection{Research Question and Sub-Problems}

The primary research question of this study focuses on: ``\ac{LLMs} be optimized for more accurate and efficient extraction of financial data from unstructured reports?" Sub-problems in this line of inquiry include: identifying the most effective LLM architectures for financial data recognition, developing methodologies for context-aware data extraction, enhancing the system's ability to handle diverse report formats, and evaluating the impact of training data quality and volume on model performance. These sub-problems are essential for understanding the intricacies of applying \ac{LLMs} to financial data extraction and for developing a comprehensive solution.

\subesection{Scope and Constraints}

The scope of this study is limited to the extraction of financial data from English-language reports, focusing on publicly available annual and quarterly financial statements. Key constraints include the variability in report formats, the complexity of financial terminology, and the inherent limitations of current LLM technologies in understanding domain-specific contexts. The study primarily revolves around the use of GPT and BERT models, considering their widespread adoption and state-of-the-art performance in text processing tasks. Main concepts involved include \ac{NLP}, machine learning, data extraction, and financial analysis, with a particular emphasis on the adaptation and optimization of LLMs for specialized data extraction tasks.

\section{Concepts and State of the Art}

% Extracting information from PDF files has been an explored area of research for both academia and industry
% TODO cite 1993
Ever since \ac{PDFs} were created by Adobe in 1993, they have been used to store and share information. These document standard quickly became a way of companies reporting their financial information for the public as well as \ac{KPI}s and other important information internally. This has led to a large amount of information being stored in \ac{PDFs}, which has led to a need to extract information from these files. A series of professions have arised from this need, such as data entry, data extraction, and data analysis. The extraction of information from \ac{PDFs} has been a manual process for most of the tasks until recent years, when \ac{OCR} and \ac{NLP} technologies have been developed to automate processes involving processing \ac{PDFs}.

% TODO cite
Extracting information from a document, recently referred to ``Document AI'' is a complex problem that often involves cross-modal interactions where information is represented in both text and visual form. This is particularly true for financial reports, where information is often presented in tables, charts, and text. The problem is further complicated by the fact that financial reports are often not standardized, and the information is presented in diverse range of formats.
% The document domain has been explored in different paradigms such as document question answering (QA) ~\cite{}, classification ~\cite{}, information extraction ~\cite{}, document summarization ~\cite{}, layout detection ~\cite{}, etc.
% There have been studies using only the text information ~\cite{}, and others focusing on visual information ~\cite{}. However, the most recent trend is to use multimodal models that can handle both text and visual information as the literature has shown in recent years ~\cite{}.

\subsection{\ac{LLMs}}

Large Language Models (\ac{LLMs}) are a class of artificial intelligence models that have been designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language at a large scale.
These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to learn language patterns, grammar, context, and even domain-specific knowledge.
As a result, \ac{LLMs} can perform a wide range of language-related tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and more, with remarkable proficiency. The development and evolution of \ac{LLMs} have been instrumental in advancing the field of natural language processing (\ac{NLP}), enabling more natural and effective human-computer interactions.
The capabilities of \ac{LLMs} have found applications in various sectors, including but not limited to customer service, content creation, and, notably, in extracting and analyzing information from documents in the field known as Document AI \cite{}.

\subsection{\ac{GPT}}

\subsection{GPT-4}

GPT-4 --- the fourth \ac{GPT} release by OpenAI, brought a significant leap in the capabilities of \ac{LLMs} when compared to its predecessor \ac{GPT}-3.
This model builds upon the architecture and training methodologies of its predecessors, incorporating lessons learned and innovations to achieve unprecedented performance across a broad spectrum of language tasks.
GPT-4 is characterized by its deep learning architecture, which allows it to generate human-like text, comprehend complex instructions, and provide accurate information and analysis based on the context provided to it.
Its training involved feeding the model with diverse and extensive datasets, enabling it to grasp nuances across different languages, cultures, and domains.
GPT-4's versatility and adaptability have made it a valuable tool in numerous applications, from creative writing assistance to sophisticated data analysis and interpretation in academic research \cite{}.

\subsection{GPT-4V}

GPT-4 Vision represents an extension of the capabilities of traditional \ac{LLMs} into the realm of visual understanding and analysis.
By integrating vision-based artificial intelligence technologies with the language processing prowess of GPT-4, this model can interpret and analyze images, diagrams, and visual data in conjunction with textual information. This multimodal approach enables GPT-4 Vision to perform tasks that require an understanding of both visual and textual content, such as extracting data from charts and graphs in financial reports, identifying key information in documents with complex layouts, and answering questions that depend on visual cues. The development of GPT-4 Vision is a testament to the ongoing advancements in AI, highlighting the move towards more integrated and comprehensive models that can navigate the complexities of human communication and information processing \cite{}.

\subsection{\ac{LLMs} for Document AI}

\ac{LLMs} have become a popular strategy in the field of Document AI, transforming how information is extracted, processed, and analyzed from documents.
In the context of Document AI, \ac{LLMs} are utilized to understand the content within documents, ranging from simple text to complex structures like tables and charts, and the relationships between different pieces of information.
These models leverage their extensive training on diverse datasets to adapt to the specific challenges posed by document analysis, such as varying formats, layouts, and the integration of multimodal data.
Through techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning, \ac{LLMs} can be specialized to perform tasks including but not limited to information extraction, document summarization, and semantic search within documents.
Their ability to process and analyze documents at scale significantly reduces the time and effort required for data entry, extraction, and analysis, enabling more efficient and accurate handling of document-based information \cite{}.

\subsection{Question answering with \ac{RAG}}

\ac{RAG} represents a novel approach in leveraging \ac{LLMs} for the task of question answering.
\ac{RAG} combines the generative capabilities of models like GPT with retrieval-based methods, which search a large corpus of documents to find relevant information that can aid in generating accurate and informative answers.
This technique involves two main components: a retriever, which identifies relevant documents or passages given a query, and a generator, which synthesizes the retrieved information into a coherent response.
By integrating these two processes, RAG is able to produce answers that are not only contextually relevant but also enriched with details and insights drawn from a wide range of sources.
This method has shown significant promise in improving the accuracy and depth of responses provided by AI systems in question answering applications, particularly in domains where detailed and specific knowledge is required, such as academic research and technical support \cite{}.
